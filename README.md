# Keeping Multiple Tab Syncronous with NGXS
#### Keeping multiple browser tab synchronous with NGXS, localStorage and Rxjs

#### Question is; How do we keep multiple tab in sync?

### With **NGXS**, **localstorage** and **Rxjs**.

    We're going to follow;

1. **Ngxs** for state management (Best state management library + pattern for Angular projects)
2. **localStorage** for keeping actions
3. **Rxjs** for detecting changes on **window.storage** with **fromEvent** operator
